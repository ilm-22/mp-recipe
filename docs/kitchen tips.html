        <h3> <u> Tip 1: Knife Skills</h3> <br></u>
         <p>A blunt knife is more slippery and cuts than a sharp knife. Keeping your knives sharp is one of the easiest ways to keep them safe. An easy fix is to use a knife sharpener to get a razor-sharp edge. Also, choose the best knife for the job at hand. In other words, cutting strawberries with a butcher knife is not a good idea. </p>

        <h3> <u> Tip 2: Use new boards for cutting raw meat and vegetables</h3> <br> </u>
        <p>You want to avoid unnecessary dishwashing, but this is one area where you shouldn't cut corners. If you use the same cutting board for meat, fruit, and vegetables, you will definitely get salmonella. To avoid cross-contamination, the USDA recommends he use two cutting boards.
One for raw meat, poultry, and seafood, and one for fresh fruit, vegetables, and bread. If you cannot avoid using the same cutting board, it is safest to cut the fruit and vegetables first, wash the board thoroughly with soap and warm water, and then prep the meat. Here's everything you need to know about caring for your cutting board.  </p>

        <h3> <u>Tip 3: Wash your hand</h3> <br></u>
        <p>You may take it for granted, but people do not forget  it is important to wash your hands with hot, soapy water before and after cooking. Additionally, to prevent the spread of food poisoning, be sure to clean any surfaces (including the sink!) that may have come into contact with raw meat or eggs. </p>

         <h3> <u>Tip 4 Learn to extinguish a fire:</h3> <br></u>
        <p>Cooking is a leading cause of fires and injuries in the home. Always have a fire extinguisher in your kitchen, know how to use it, and be ready to act.Learn how to deal with different types of fires, including grease fires and electrical fires. Never extinguish a fire with water. Instead, extinguish it with baking soda or a pot lid. Oven fires are best extinguished with a fire extinguisher. A microwave fire can be extinguished simply by turning off the unit and keeping the door closed. </p>

         <h3> <u>Tip 5: Donâ€™t set a hot glass dish on a wet or cold surface</h3> <br></u>
        <p>There's actually a lot of science behind this tip. Glass expands when heated and contracts when cooled, creating stresses that cause the glass to burn. So be careful when putting Pyrex in the oven. Also, be careful with the lid of the glass pot. Jar lids are best placed on trivets, cutting boards, or oven mitts. Do not place on stovetops, especially glass stovetops. </p>

        <img src="pans.jpg" alt="Tip 6" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
        <h3><u>Tip 6: Be mindful of pans</h3> <br></u>
        <p> When cooking, make sure the handles of pots and pans are pointing toward the center of the stove. As such, it is difficult to dump hot liquids by bumping them. Always have dry potholders or oven mitts ready when working with things on the stove or oven. When it gets wet or damp, it conducts heat more easily. </p>

          <h3><u>Tip 7: Do not use metal utensils on non-stick pans</h3> <br> </u>
        <p> Do not use metal utensils on non-stick pans.
Non-stick pans are safe to cook with the proper cooking utensils. However, on metal utensils, the nonstick coating may chip or chip off. This can introduce a toxic compound called PFA into your food. Better solution:
Use wooden or plastic spoons. This type of frying pan is not designed to last.</p>
